# 4th_ReactJS

My fourth ReactJS repo. It's all about simple animation with framer-motion.

View it here - https://Yuvraj-Kaushal.github.io/4th_ReactJS/

You can also use framer-motion by typing the command below in your terminal

Command - npm install framer-motion

You can see my code that how I have implemented this by cloning my proj in your system.
